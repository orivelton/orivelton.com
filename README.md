1.  **`/content`**: A content folder holding assets that the theme expects to exist. This will vary from theme to theme -- this starter is set up to get you started with the blog theme, which expects an image asset for your avatar, and blog post content. Replace the avatar image file, delete the demo posts, and add your own!

2.  **`/src`**: You will probably want to customize your site to personalize it. The files under `/src/gatsby-theme-blog` _shadow_, or override, the files of the same name in the `gatsby-theme-blog` package. To learn more about this, check out the [guide to getting started with using the blog theme starter](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme).

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This file tells [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) which configuration it should use to lint files.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins youâ€™d like to include, etc. When using themes, it's where you'll include the theme plugin, and any customization options the theme provides.

6.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

7.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You wonâ€™t change this file directly).**

8.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the projectâ€™s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

9.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
