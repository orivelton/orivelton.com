*If you setup any [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) by default we have the [@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) added.*


The best way to debugging a screen is the `logTestingPlaygroundURL()` method which logs a URL that can be opened in a browser.

Let's take a look at this example below.


## My *Avatar* component

<hr /><br />

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Avatar = (): JSX.Element => {
    return <img alt="Remy Sharp" src="https://i.pravatar.cc/100" />
}

export default Avatar


```
