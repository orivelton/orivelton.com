*If you setup any [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) by default we have the [@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) added.*


The best way to debugging a screen is the `logTestingPlaygroundURL()` method which logs a URL that can be opened in a browser.

Let's take a look at this example below.


1 - **My Avatar component**
<hr />

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ze3nvd?embed=1&file=src/Avatar.js&hideNavigation=1&view=editor" loading="lazy" height="300" width="100%"></iframe>
<hr />

<br />

2 - **My Avatar unit test**
<hr />

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ze3nvd?embed=1&file=src/Avatar.test.js&hideNavigation=1&view=editor" loading="lazy" height="300" width="100%"></iframe>
<hr /><br />

Run the unit test command and let's see the result

This way we can spec any element and get some query, below you can find an example:

<hr />

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ze3nvd?embed=1&file=src/Avatar.test1.js&hideNavigation=1&view=editor" loading="lazy" height="300" width="100%"></iframe>
<br />
<br />


While we developers love to code, sometimes it's better to take a break from the drudgery and let other tools do some of the heavy lifting for us. This is where the test playground comes in.

The UI feels like an inspection item in the developer tools, so there is no learning curve to get the most out of the site. To make it even more convenient, there is also a browser [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano?hl=en) that allows you to interact with any website!

# Conclusion

Writing tests can be less fun than developing new features, and having to rewrite tests every time you update your code makes it even less fun. We need to stop testing implementation details and start mirroring user interactions.
