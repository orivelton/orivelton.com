## What is the `Navigator.vibrate()` method?

If you need vibrate a mobile device then you can use this method that will return true if have success otherwise will return a `false` value.
This method has a required argument, we can parssing a `0` value, an array empty or with a sequencial of numbers.  

## How to access in the browser?

On browser you can use the syntax <code>***window.navigator.vibrate(0)***</code>

```javascript
  window.navigator.vibrate(0)
  window.navigator.vibrate([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100])
```

Each Pattern has a different vibration, if you start a new event the event before will stop automatically

## What is Pattern with `Navigator.vibrate()` method?

When we provide a pattern of vibration and pause intervals it's mean that each value indicates a number of milliseconds to vibrate or pause

For Example: 

```javascript
  [100,30,100,30,100,30,200,30,200,30,200,30,100,30,100,30,100] Vibrate 'SOS' in Morse
```
